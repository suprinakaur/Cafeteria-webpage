	Vegetables and meats are purchased raw and prepared in each cafeteriaâ€™s kitchen.
	Breads are kneaded by hand and pie crusts start with flour and water.
 	No microwaves are used for cooking in K&W kitchens. Items are made in small batches 
	throughout the day to ensure freshness and control waste. 
	Our daily offering of over 100 foods are made from scratch, and customers 
	can be assured that K&W uses only fresh, wholesome ingredients.
